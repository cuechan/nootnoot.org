      <h2>Language</h2>
      <p>
        Pingu and his family communicate in a "Penguin Language" known as "Pinguish" or "Penguinese"<br> 
        which mainly consists of "noot" "neet" "nute" and "nit". As such, the introduction song transcribes<br> 
        as "Neet nit nit nute nit neet nit noot (Pingu, Pingu)";
